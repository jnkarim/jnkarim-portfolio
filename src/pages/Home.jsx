                                Hello, I'm Julker Nayeen Karim, a 3rd-year Computer
                                Science and Engineering undergraduate at
                                Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology
                                (AUST) with a passion for transforming complex
                                problems into elegant software solutions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With a strong foundation in both theoretical
                                computer science and practical development, I
                                have experience in full-stack web development
                                and competitive programming. My technical
                                expertise spans across C++ Java, and JavaScript
                                ecosystems, including modern frameworks like
                                React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Laravel.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I have also won several prizes in
                                intra-university contests, showcasing my
                                problem-solving skills and teamwork. When I'm
                                not coding, you'll likely find me enjoying a
                                good detective or mystery novel or playing
                                console games. I'm also an avid football fan.
                            </p>
